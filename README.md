I wear two distinct yet complementary hats in the digital landscape.

As a seasoned author and content creator, I specialize in the **crypto, blockchain, fintech, NFT, and Web3** domains. My background in international politics, economics, and finance enriches my content, making it both insightful and impactful. I excel in creating in-depth articles on blockchain technology, DeFi, NFTs, and the broader crypto industry. My technical analysis skills include Volume Analysis, Elliott Waves Theory, and Fibonacci targets. Additionally, I'm well-versed in SEO, ensuring that my content not only engages but also ranks well.

On the flip side, I'm a **prompt engineer and data scientist** dedicated to pushing the boundaries of AI. I craft intelligent prompts that enhance conversational AI technologies like ChatGPT and drive AI-powered image generation with tools like Midjourney. My expertise extends to developing predictive models and leveraging data to inform AI solutions, combining language, visuals, and technology in innovative ways.
